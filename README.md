## Structure
The main structure is menu-driven program capable of:
* Data visualisation through graphs 
* Manipulation (inserting a record, deleting a record, dropping a column, etc.)
* Displaying (the top records, the bottom records, particular column(s), particular row(s))
* Saving changes
* Read csv files                                
  Some features are only available for a particular .csv file and can be used for other files after slight adaptation

## Why we have selected Python Programming Language?
Python is a powerful programming language that is absolutely easy to read, update, and maintain. It comes with a clean and structured code base that makes the entire updation and maintenance process a lot easier for the developers. They donâ€™t need to write surplus code that largely cuts down on their effort and valuable time.
The syntax rule of Python is primarily comprised of English keywords that improve readability
Python has a massive and powerful standard library.
It is available free of cost, making DATO cost efficient.

## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS 
Google Colab / Jupyter 

## What inspired us?
Curiosity and pro-active interests in the programming language, functions, experiments for achieving knowledge and encouraging derivatives in the same direction were the soul inspirations driving DATO.

## Purpose
DATO has been made for visualization of data related to Olympics as per users various needs, for editing of data if required, for analysing and displaying the data in an efficient manner and to encourage derivatives in the same direction.
